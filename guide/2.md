# Action events
There are many different event types that can trigger an action.
You can read [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) to see an exhaustive list provided by github himself.

Manual dispatches are great but they are manual. This can be useful sometimes when we want to input values, but actions is all about automating processes. Let's see a common use case.

## scene
Me: _I have a PR ready for review. Can someone please review it?_

You: _ok._

... you start to review and realize that tests are not passing ...

You: _darn. these tests are not passing and I could have been doing something else_

If there was an action that ran tests when someone made a PR, then you could alert the author they should probably make sure all tests pass before a review!
## 

To make an action be triggered by a pull request you can do:
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
```
Now that's fine. But there are different [activity types](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows) for pull requests.
So we probably want to use the `opened` activity:
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
```

## exercise
Create a yaml that just echoes "Check that all tests pass!"

Obviously this is kinda silly but we will improve on this action in coming examples.

To test that your workflow works, commit and push it to the main branch and then open up a pr in github. The action should be triggered by this.
